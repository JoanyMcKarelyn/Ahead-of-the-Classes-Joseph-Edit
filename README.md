# Ahead of the Classes Lite

Lite version of Danae and Merlord's [Ahead of the Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50346), adding starting equipment and spells without new classes.

What's lite about this mod is one, cutting out all the NPC classes, TR classes, new classes that Danae worked very hard on, and two, removing or replacing all modded gear, including OAAB TR items. But it also adds and changes a few features:

- Compatible with [Better Character Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47078): the original is not compatible with Better Character Classes. The preset loadouts from this mod are for Better Character Classes only, which means if you don't have that installed, all the vanilla playable classes will use the skill mapping to decide what to add instead. 
- Equipments and spells downgrade: The average budget is 185 gold, with lowest being 50 and the highest being 500. 
- Every preset class has 2 loadouts to randomly pick from. 
- Custom class loadouts have been greatly modified: All starting characters have 'random' clothing and gold. Characters specializing in magic will be given robes. 

I consider this mod to be a middle ground between [Merlord's Starting Equipment](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47283) and [Ahead of the Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50346), both of which are created by Ordinator Danae and Merlord. All credits go to them, since I did nothing more than tweaking the custom classes table. I am very grateful that they let me upload it here.
