# Ahead of the Classes - Joseph Edit
This mod is a lite version of Danae and Merlord's Ahead of the Classes, with compatibility for Better Character Classes, and without all the new playable classes and TR OAAB dependency. 

This is a standalone version and no esp needed. 
  
The loadouts have been changed to better suit BTBGI. The average budget is 185 gold, with lowest being 50 and the highest being 500. Every preset class has 2 loadouts to randomly pick from. All modded gear has been removed or replaced by vanilla items/spells. Custom class loadouts have been greaty modified as well. All starting characters have 'random' clothing. Characters whose custom class has Magic as specialization will be given robes.
