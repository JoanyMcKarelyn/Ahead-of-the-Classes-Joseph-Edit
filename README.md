# Ahead of the Classes - Joseph Edit
This mod is a lite version of Danae and Merlord's Ahead of the Classes, with compatibility for Better Character Classes, and without all the new playable classes and TR OAAB dependency. 
  
The loadouts have been changed to better suit BTBGI. The average budget is 185 gold, with lowest being 50 and the highest being 500. Every vanilla playable class has 2 loadouts to randomly pick from. All modded gear has been removed or replaced by vanilla items/spells.
