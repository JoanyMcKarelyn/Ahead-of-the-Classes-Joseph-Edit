# Ahead of the Classes - Joseph Edit
This mod is a lite and rebalanced version of Danae and Merlord's [Ahead of the Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50346), with compatibility for [Better Character Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47078), and without all the new playable classes and TR OAAB dependency. 

This is a standalone version and no esp needed. 
  
The loadouts have been changed to better suit [BTB's Game Improvements - Necro Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47129). The average budget is 185 gold, with lowest being 50 and the highest being 500. Every preset class has 2 loadouts to randomly pick from. All modded gear has been removed or replaced by vanilla items/spells. Custom class loadouts have been greatly modified as well. All starting characters have 'random' clothing and gold. Characters whose custom class has Magic as specialization will be given robes. 

The preset loadouts are for Better Character Classes only, which means if you don't have that installed, all the vanilla playable classes uses custom class formula to decide what gear to add.
